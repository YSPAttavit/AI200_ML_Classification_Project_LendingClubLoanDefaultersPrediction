## Background
Business Case: Develop a Machine Learning model for the company to identify if the loan applicant is likely or unlikely to default on the loan, thereby assisting in the company's portfolio & risk assessment capabilities

Exploratory Data Analysis [EDA], feature-engineering & model testing was conducted using **Python** within the **JupyterNotebook** environment. Various feature engineering techniques & models were experimented & the best AUC scoring model was then selected & applied to form the final model.

The final model, along with the feature-engineered dataframe, acheived a **~90% predictive AUC score** after cross-validation via the Kaggle platform, thus demonstrating a strong ablity to discriminate between loan applicants whom are likely or unlikely to default on loans.
